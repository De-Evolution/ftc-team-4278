\maketitle

\begin{fancyquotes}
Ever since last spring, when their team members did a presentation at our school for Science Discovery Day, they have been an inspiration to our robotics students and are chiefly responsible for encouraging our 8th graders to start an FTC team this year. All the members have been great role models and were truly deserving of the ``Inspiration'' award they received at the Escondido QT. They have designed an amazing robot and I hope they go far at the San Diego Regional Championship!

\begin{abstract}
\textbf{FTC Team 4278 proposes} the creation of a robot to address all aspects of the FTC 2013-14 competition, ``Block Party.'' The proposed design has the capacity to address, in the teleoperated period: (1) retrieval of blocks; (2) placement of blocks into the block crates; (3) raising the FTC flag; (4) hanging against the field bar. In addition, during the autonomous period, the robot will address the following elements: (1) placement of blocks in the correct bin, as indicated by an IR beacon; (2) maneuvering to the ramp. 

In order to achieve these goals, it was determined that the robot should: (1) be very difficult to push; (2) be fast and reliable in movement; (3) have a low center of gravity; (4) have as few unique components as possible; (5) be as compact as possible; (6) pick up blocks with at most one motion; (7) place blocks in crates with at most one motion; (8) hang with at most either two motions on an existing component, or one motion on a new component; (9) be able to raise the flag with one component; (10) be electrically stable, generating as little static as possible. 

Goals set for autonomous include: (1) being able to score in the crate denoted by the IR beacon; (2) being able to travel to the nearest ramp; (3) being able to address and recover from any problems which may arise on the field, including, but not limited to, obstructions caused by other robots; (4) potentially being able to score both autonomous blocks. For (3), the intent is to travel onto the ramp regardless of potential obstruction by other robots. Decision logic is used to avoid obstructions.

Over the course of this engineering document, we address these problems, determine how we solve them, and explain the process which lead to these conclusions. Most notably, the development of a prototype robot allowed us to identify critical problems with our design and address them before implementation.

The code which goes into this design will also be explained.

\textbf{FTC Team 4278 also aims} to create a foundation for all FIRST teams by: (1) helping teams online and in the pits where possible; (2) promoting the philosophy that the FIRST Tech Challenge is primarily about education and secondarily about competition; (3) raising awareness about FIRST in our high school and region; (4) supporting the success of teams through the distribution of knowledge and acquired experience.

We aim to, first and foremost, help teams succeed - the competition is not genuine if teams are not operating at maximum capacity - and secondarily, spread awareness about FIRST to students everywhere to bring them into the FIRST program.
