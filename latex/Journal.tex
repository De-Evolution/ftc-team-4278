\section{Meeting \#1: 09/01/2013}
We held a preseason meeting in order to go over scheduling, recruitment of new members, and hold a quick review of what we learned from our last season. One of the main items we discussed was our scheduling, and as a team we decided to take an aggressive approach towards our first couple of regional competitions in order to secure a place in St. Louis. Because of this, we may need to cut back on scoring the maximum number of points and instead focus on scoring a high, yet consistent number of points. We found out that we need to secure our electronics and work with the field control issues that we were issues. We also plan on placing a much larger emphasis on the CAD design of our robot than we have in our two previous years as it is an efficient way to quickly discover and troubleshoot problems prior to building the system. 

Our final goal is to have two weeks of drive practice before our first regional on December 14th, important for both driver and coaches, to figure out the timing of the game, as well as things that we can or cannot do in game. Organization of the team this year will be facilitated through the use of Google Groups, which will allow all the team members and their parents to be easily contacted for meetings, and will hopefully foster some discussion over build design or game strategy. 

We also decided to meet a few hours after the game was released next week so team members could think about strategies ahead of time and add to the strategy discussion of our first meeting of the season. The meeting was fairly short, but got the team in the right mindset for the upcoming season, and got everyone excited for the  new season!
