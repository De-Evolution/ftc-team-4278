FTC Team 4278 proposes the creation of a robot to address all aspects of the FTC 2013-14 competition, ``Block Party.'' The proposed design has the capacity to address, in the teleoperated period: (1) retrieval of blocks; (2) placement of blocks into the block crates; (3) raising the FTC flag; (4) hanging against the field bar. In addition, during the autonomous period, the robot will address the following elements: (1) placement of blocks in the correct bin, as indicated by an IR beacon; (2) maneuvering to the ramp. 

In order to achieve these goals, it was determined that the robot should: (1) be very difficult to push; (2) be fast and reliable in movement; (3) have a low center of gravity; (4) have as few unique components as possible; (5) be as compact as possible; (6) pick up blocks with at most one motion; (7) place blocks in crates with at most one motion; (8) hang with at most either two motions on an existing component, or one motion on a new component; (9) be able to raise the flag with one component; (10) be electrically stable, generating as little static as possible. 

Goals set for autonomous include: (1) being able to score in the crate denoted by the IR beacon; (2) being able to travel to the nearest ramp; (3) being able to address and recover from any problems which may arise on the field, including, but not limited to, obstructions caused by other robots; (4) potentially being able to score both autonomous blocks. For (3), the intent is to travel onto the ramp regardless of potential obstruction by other robots. Decision logic is used to avoid obstructions.

Over the course of this engineering document, we address these problems, determine how we solve them, and explain the process which lead to these conclusions. Most notably, the development of a prototype robot allowed us to identify critical problems with our design and address them before implementation.

Additionally, the code which goes into this design will be explained.
